## Notes

### Event & Style Props
these are a few from a lot of Event:
- Click button => MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>
- Change Input => ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>

The `<HTMLButtonElement>` its mean that we want to give more specific information about the Event or something like restrict the Event.

For Style Props, we can use:
styles: CSSProperties or React.CSSProperties
